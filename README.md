# Creditcard-fraud-detection

•	The project involves preprocessing and selecting relevant features from transaction data, such as transaction amount, time, location, and customer behavior patterns, to effectively differentiate between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
•	A Random Forest classifier, which is an ensemble learning method, is trained on a labeled dataset of past transactions. The model learns to classify transactions based on patterns and irregularities commonly associated with fraud.
•	The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation are employed to optimize the model, ensuring a balance between detecting fraud (true positives) and minimizing false alarms (false positives).
